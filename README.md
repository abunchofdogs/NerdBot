NerdBot
=======

NancyFX rewrite of a basic GroupMe bot that lets you query for Magic: The Gathering card and price information. Original bot is written in Python and uses Flask but I figured, it is a good project to get more familiar with Nancy and MongoDB.

Each command that the bot can use will be written as plugins.
