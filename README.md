NerdBot
=======

NancyFX rewrite of a basic GroupMe bot that lets you query for Magic: The Gathering card and price information. Original bot is written in Python and uses Flask but I figured, it is a good project to get more familiar with Nancy and MongoDB.

Each command that the bot can use will be written as plugins.

Builds in Visual Studio 2012 and Xamarin Studio 5.7.

Tested on Windows 7, Windows 10 x64 and Ubuntu 14.04, 15.04 x86_64 using Mono 3.2.8.
